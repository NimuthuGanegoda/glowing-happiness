# Audi Q2 Rental Website

Simple, responsive single‑page website to showcase and take booking requests for an Audi Q2 rental. Built with plain HTML/CSS/JS, easy to customize and deploy (e.g., GitHub Pages).

## Features
- Clean, mobile‑first landing page
- Car highlights/specs and simple pricing cards
- Booking form (via FormSubmit – no backend required)
- Gallery with a lightweight JS lightbox
- Accessible navigation with mobile menu

## Quick Start
Open `index.html` in your browser. That’s it.

Optionally use a static server for live reload:

```bash
# Python (3.x)
python3 -m http.server 8080
# then visit http://localhost:8080
```

## Customize
- Branding: update the site name and links in `index.html` header.
- Pricing: edit the cards in the `#pricing` section of `index.html`.
- Specs/Content: update the `#car` section and hero copy.
- Images: replace Unsplash URLs in the `#gallery` and hero with your own photos.
- Colors/Theme: adjust CSS variables in `assets/css/styles.css` under `:root`.

## Booking Form (FormSubmit)
The booking form posts to FormSubmit so you receive requests by email without a backend.

1. In `index.html`, search for `formsubmit` and replace `YOUREMAIL@example.com` with your email.
2. First submission may ask you to confirm the email with FormSubmit.
3. You can add hidden fields (see formsubmit.co docs) for redirects or spam protection.

If you prefer WhatsApp: replace the form with a CTA link like `https://wa.me/<number>?text=...`.

## Deploy (GitHub Pages)
1. Push this repo to GitHub.
2. In your repository settings → Pages → Set source to `main` and folder to `/ (root)`.
3. The site will be live at `https://<your-user>.github.io/<repo>/`.

Alternatively host on Netlify, Vercel, Cloudflare Pages, or any static host.

## Notes
- Demo photos use Unsplash and are for placeholder purposes. Replace with your Audi Q2 images.
- No tracking or analytics included by default.
